Random Quote displaying app using rest api services

About:
    I developed this app to learn electronjs framework

    This app fetches random quotes from the 'quotesondesign.com' free rest api
    and for every 10 seconds new quote will be displayed.

Instruction to run the app:

    1.NodeJs dependency required
    2.after cloning perform 'npm install'
    3.next execute 'npm start' to start the application

Note :
    To change the interval of quote appearing, modify all the setInterval() functions in the index.js file
